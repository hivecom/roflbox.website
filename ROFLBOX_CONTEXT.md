# ROFLBOX Context for Developers

## What is ROFLBOX?

ROFLBOX is a **parody project** inspired by LMAOBOX, a notorious cheat tool that used to exist in Team Fortress 2. 

### The Concept

ROFLBOX is essentially a fake "hack toolkit" designed to ragebait opposing players in games like Rocket League. When players get scored on, they can use a macro to spam messages like:

```
ARE YOU NOOB? WANT TO BE PRO? DOWNLOAD ROFLBOX TO GROW UP! ROFLBOX(DOT)WEBSITE FOR BEST H4X!!!
```

**Important:** ROFLBOX is NOT a real hacking tool. It's purely a parody/joke project meant to mimic the spam messages that bots and cheaters used to post in TF2 chat.

## Website Design Philosophy

The website should be intentionally **over-the-top and badly designed** to make it clear this is a parody that can't possibly be taken seriously. Think:

- **Way too many transitions and effects**
- **Multiple different fonts** mixed together
- **Random functionality that makes no sense**
- **Parody levels of bad design**
- **Excessive animations and visual noise**
- **Ridiculous claims and features**

### Design Goals

1. Make it obviously a joke/parody
2. Embrace the "early 2000s hacker website" aesthetic
3. Include intentionally bad UI/UX decisions
4. Add nonsensical features and claims
5. Use excessive visual effects and animations

### Technical Implementation

While the design should be intentionally bad, the underlying code should still be:
- Modern and maintainable
- Built with proper React/TypeScript patterns
- Deployable to GitHub Pages
- Accessible to screen readers (despite the visual chaos)

## For Future Development

When working on this project, remember:
- The worse it looks, the better (within reason)
- Every design decision should contribute to the parody
- Add features that don't make sense but look "hacky"
- Embrace the meme culture around fake cheat tools
