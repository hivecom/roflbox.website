# GitHub Copilot Instructions for ROFLBOX

## Project Overview

ROFLBOX is a **parody website** that mimics fake "hacker toolkit" websites. It's inspired by LMAOBOX, a notorious cheat tool from Team Fortress 2 where bots would spam chat with promotional messages. This is purely satirical and designed to be obviously fake.

## The Core Concept

### Chat Spam Origin
The project stems from a macro used in games like Rocket League to ragebait opposing players after scoring. The classic message is:

```
ARE YOU NOOB? WANT TO BE PRO? DOWNLOAD ROFLBOX TO GROW UP! ROFLBOX(DOT)WEBSITE FOR BEST H4X!!!
```

### Parody Nature
- **NOT a real hacking tool** - purely satirical
- **Intentionally over-the-top** to make it obviously fake
- **Mimics early 2000s "hacker" websites** with terrible design
- **Parodies LMAOBOX from TF2** where bots spammed similar messages

## Design Philosophy: "Parody Levels Bad"

### Visual Design Requirements
- **Multiple conflicting fonts** (mono, serif, sans mixed chaotically)
- **Excessive animations** (blinking text, pulsing elements, bouncing buttons)
- **Rainbow borders and neon color schemes**
- **Way too many visual effects and transitions**
- **Fake "hacker terminal" with matrix-style effects**
- **Over-the-top claims** about fictional tools (Aimbot 9000, SpeedHax, WallHax)

### UI/UX Anti-Patterns to Embrace
- **Random functionality that makes no sense**
- **Inconsistent spacing and alignment**
- **Clashing color combinations**
- **Unnecessary sound effects and animations**
- **Popup windows and fake system alerts**
- **Spinning graphics and marquee text**

## Technical Stack

### Core Technologies
- **React 19** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS v4.1.12** with @tailwindcss/postcss
- **Shadcn/ui** component library (Button, Card components)
- **Node.js 22** (latest LTS)

### Deployment
- **GitHub Actions** workflow for automatic deployment
- **GitHub Pages** hosting at `https://roflbox.website`
- **Static site generation** for optimal performance

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
Despite the intentionally chaotic visual design, maintain:
- **Modern React patterns** with functional components and hooks
- **TypeScript type safety** throughout the codebase
- **Proper component composition** using Shadcn's design system
- **Accessible markup structure** (despite visual chaos)
- **Clean, maintainable code** that follows best practices

### Design Implementation Rules
1. **The worse it looks visually, the better** (within reason)
2. **Every design decision should contribute to the parody**
3. **Add features that look "hacky" but don't make sense**
4. **Embrace meme culture around fake cheat tools**
5. **Make it impossible to take seriously**

### Content Guidelines
- **Fake tool names** like "Aimbot 9000", "SpeedHax", "WallHax"
- **Ridiculous performance claims** and statistics
- **Tech gibberish** in terminal outputs
- **Over-the-top testimonials** from "satisfied customers"
- **Nonsensical feature lists** with impressive-sounding names

## Key Features to Maintain

### Essential Elements
- **Prominent chat spam message display**
- **Fake hacker terminal** with scrolling text
- **Intentionally bad color scheme** (emerald/teal/purple gradient)
- **Multiple animation effects** running simultaneously
- **Fake download buttons** and system requirements
- **Parody "testimonials" and "proof" videos**

### Technical Features
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices
- **Fast loading times** despite visual complexity
- **SEO optimization** for discoverability
- **Proper error handling** and fallbacks

## Future Development Priorities

### Visual Enhancements
- More excessive animations and effects
- Additional fake "hacking tools" and features
- Sound effects and audio feedback
- Fake loading screens and progress bars

### Content Expansion
- More parody testimonials and reviews
- Fake changelog and update history
- Ridiculous system requirements
- Fake community forum or chat

### Technical Improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Better accessibility features
- Enhanced SEO and metadata
- Additional component library integration

## Important Notes for AI Assistance

### Context Understanding
- Always remember this is **PARODY/SATIRE** - not promoting real cheating
- The goal is to make it **obviously fake and humorous**
- **Intentionally bad design** is the feature, not a bug
- Maintain **high code quality** despite chaotic visuals

### When Adding Features
- Ask yourself: "Does this make the parody more obvious?"
- Embrace anti-patterns in UI/UX design
- Add unnecessary complexity and visual noise
- Include fake technical jargon and impressive-sounding nonsense

### Avoid
- Making it look professional or legitimate
- Clean, minimal design choices
- Subtle animations or effects
- Real hacking information or techniques
- Anything that could be mistaken for a real tool

This project celebrates the absurdity of fake cheat tool websites while showcasing modern web development skills underneath the intentionally chaotic surface.
